Big data is a field that treats ways to analyze, systematically extract information from, or otherwise deal with data sets that
 are too large or complex to be dealt with by traditional data-processing application software. Data with many cases (rows) offer greater statistical power, 
 while data with higher complexity (more attributes or columns) may lead to a higher false discovery rate.[2] Big data challenges include capturing data, data storage,
  data analysis, search, sharing, transfer, visualization, querying, updating, information privacy and data source. 
  Big data was originally associated with three key concepts: volume, variety, and velocity.
   When we handle big data, we may not sample but simply observe and track what happens.
 Therefore, big data often includes data with sizes that exceed the capacity of traditional software to process within an acceptable time and value
