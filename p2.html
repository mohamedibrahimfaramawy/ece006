    <td>UAt a high level, a big data strategy is a plan designed to help you oversee and improve the way you acquire, store, manage, 
      share and use data within and outside of your organization.
       A big data strategy sets the stage for business success amid an abundance of data. 
       When developing a strategy, it’s important to consider existing – and future – business and technology goals and initiatives.
        This calls for treating big data like any other valuable business asset rather than just a byproduct of applications.SA</td>
    <td>Streaming data comes from the Internet of Things (IoT) and other connected devices that flow into IT systems from wearables,
       smart cars, medical devices, industrial equipment and more.
        You can analyze this big data as it arrives, deciding which data to keep or not keep, and which needs further analysis. 
      Social media data stems from interactions on Facebook, YouTube, Instagram, etc.
       This includes vast amounts of big data in the form of images, videos, voice, text and sound – useful for marketing, sales and support functions.
        This data is often in unstructured or semistructured forms, so it poses a unique challenge for consumption and analysis. 
      Publicly available data comes from massive amounts of open data sources like the US government’s data.gov, the CIA World Factbook or
       the European Union Open Data Portal. 
      Other big data may come from data lakes, cloud data sources, suppliers and customers.</td>
    <td>Modern computing systems provide the speed, power and flexibility needed to quickly access massive amounts and types of big data.
       Along with reliable access, companies also need methods for integrating the data, ensuring data quality, providing data governance and storage,
        and preparing the data for analytics. Some data may be stored on-premises in a traditional data warehouse
         – but there are also flexible, low-cost options for storing and handling big data via cloud solutions,data lakes and Hadoop.</td>
    <td>4) Analyze big data

      With high-performance technologies like grid computing or in-memory analytics, organizations can choose to use all their big data for analyses. 
      Another approach is to determine upfront which data is relevant before analyzing it. 
      Either way, big data analytics is how companies gain value and insights from data. Increasingly, 
      big data feeds today’s advanced analytics endeavors such as artificial intelligence.</td>
    <td>Well-managed, trusted data leads to trusted analytics and trusted decisions.
       To stay competitive, businesses need to seize the full value of big data and operate in a data-driven way
        – making decisions based on the evidence presented by big data rather than gut instinct. The benefits of being data-driven are clear. 
      Data-driven organizations perform better, are operationally more predictable and are more profitable.</td>
